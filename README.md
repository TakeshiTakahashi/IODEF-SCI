IODEF-SCI
=========

This repository provides several tools that enable the exchange of IODEF-SCI documents between parties.
IODEF-SCI is the IETF draft that extends IODEF so that IODEF document can embed structured cybersecurity information (SCI).
For instance, it can embed MMDEF, CEE, MAEC in XML and CVE identifiers.
Currently, this page provides three tools: generator, exchager, and parser. The generator generates IODEF-SCI document or appends an XML to existing IODEF document. The exchanger sends the IODEF document to its correspondent onde. The parser receives, parses, and stores the IODEF-SCI document. It also equips the interface that enable users to locate IODEF-SCI documents it has ever received.
The code has been released under an MIT license and development will continue here. 
Through this, we wish to advance the security information exchange and circulation beyond organization borders.
